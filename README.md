# California-fire-incidents-
Personal Project for Data Science
California has the most outstanding fire across United States so I figured it would be interesting to find out which particular counties contribute the most incidents of wildfire. The data can be found at a creditable source which is data.ca.gov. The website has all sorts of information about data about California. What I’m going to base my findings on is how many fire incidents each county has and most importantly how many acres are burned in each one.
