# California-fire-incidents-
Personal Project for Data Science
California has the most outstanding fire across United States so I figured it would be interesting to find out which particular counties contribute the most incidents of wildfire. The data can be found at a creditable source which is data.ca.gov. The website has all sorts of information about data about California. What Iâ€™m going to base my findings on is how many fire incidents each county has and most importantly how many acres are burned in each one.
